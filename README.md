## Using mobile technology to improve phonological awareness and letter recognition in preschoolers.
### by Yaroslav Litvak

This study explored the efficacy of using mobile technology to help preschoolers develop early literacy skills. An existing iPad application Учубука was used in a single subject study design to determine the effect of daily sessions using the application on phonological awareness and letter recognition. The subject was trained on the use of the application via a peer-to-peer tutoring model, and the efficacy of the training was also studied. Standard Celeration Charts were used to conclude that peer to peer tutoring has a significant effect on treatment compliance in preschool subjects. The author further concluded that daily treatment sessions with an application designed to improve literacy increased letter recognition and phonetic awareness in preschoolers. This finding indicates that mobile technology can be used within the guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics to effectively develop early literacy skills in preschool-age children. Due to the single subject study design, further research is necessary to generalize the results to other populations. The study is published as a white paper.

## Application:

This research was based on an existing early literacy iPad application Учубука, which can be downloaded here:
